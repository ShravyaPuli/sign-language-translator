# How to Push Your Sign Language Generator to GitHub

## Quick Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/ShravyaPuli
2. Click the green "New" button or "+" icon → "New repository"
3. Repository name: `sign-language-generator` (or any name you prefer)
4. Description: `Real-Time AI Sign Language Generator with Web Speech API`
5. Choose **Public** or **Private** as you prefer
6. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
7. **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
8. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code
After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\shrav\OneDrive\Pictures\ISL\Real-Time-AI-Sign-Language-Generator-From-Spoken-Language"
git remote set-url shravya https://github.com/ShravyaPuli/[YOUR-REPO-NAME].git
git push shravya main
```

Replace `[YOUR-REPO-NAME]` with whatever you named your repository.
